### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Markus. I started as a backend PHP developer but work mostly with Go now. 
Lately I have worked in management positions as I find myself to be a natural leader and 
enjoy working with others to solve problems.

Here on GitHub I share a lot of my personal projects that I enjoy working on. I hope that
publishing my code can connect me with like-minded collaborators but also help others learn 
from the projects I have created.
